TOC created table of content. TOC_depth says how many headers you want in the TOC. TOC_float makes the TOC on the side instead of the top. Bib needs to start at the beginning of the header section. 

# Introduction {#Introduction}
This is an introduction to reproducibility in R. 
The curly brackets allow you to link back to this section later. 

## Starting with RStudio
Information about RStudio

### Keep dat hashtag game strong
Keep adding hashtags for increasingly small headings. 

You can add **bold text with double asterisks** or __bold text with double underscores__
You can also use *italics text with single asterisks* or  _single underscores_

Adding superscript is ^easy^, using ^.  

Add subscript using ~tilde~. 

If you add inline code use the backtick `to write code`.

Use the strikethrough text with ~~double~~ tilde. 

If you're writing a lot of text
then you might want to break it up on your screen but not on the website. This is why you need to put a double space at the end of the sentence to go to the next line. 

But if you have a long sentence

and break it up with two enters, it will split it. 

You can also use the \
backslash. 

We have covered this in the [Introduction section](#Introduction)

If I want something to go to the next line without an empty line in between  
Like this. I just put a double space at the end of the sentence.  

You can also create [links to websites like Google](https://www.google.com).

Put the link to the footnote here [^1].  

[^1]: This is how you add footnotes. 

## Lists

Ordered lists take numbers

1. Item a
2. item b
3. Item c
    a. Sublist 1
    b. Sublist 2

You also have unordered lists:  

- Item A
- Item B

* Item C
* Item D

- [ ]
- [x]

If you upload the above to GitHub it will create a ticked box. 

You can also imbed photos!  

![A cow](https://cdn.britannica.com/55/174255-050-526314B6/brown-Guernsey-cow.jpg)

You can also put photos from your local computer by doing the same as above, but instead of a website link, you put the (relative) file path. 

## Tables

You can create tables using | - 

| Column header | Another column | 
| ------------- | -------------- |
| First row     | With info      |
| More rows     | With more info |

> A greater-than sign creates blocks 

How does the look? 

How would we highlight code?

Single `backticks` are used inline. 

Three backticks create a code chunk. 

```
Here is my code chunk. 
Lookin' good. 
```

Control + Alt + I is a shortcut to insert an R code chunk. 

```{r}

print("This is my R code chunk")

for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}

```

```{r}
75 * 8
```

```{r}
calculation_output <- 100*2

calculation_output
```

```{r}
calculation_output * 5
```
